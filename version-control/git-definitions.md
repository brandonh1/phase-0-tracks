# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows users to see the history of all revisions made. Developers use it because they have the option to go back and fix any problems that might have happened. Developers can also see who made which revision.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is like a copy of your project. You would use one to test code without messing up your actual project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point. A good commit message tells you specific information on what you did during that save point.

* What is a merge conflict?
It happens when theres a problem with merging files. One person might modify a line and then another person might delete the modified line.
