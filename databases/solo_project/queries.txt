1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
-----------
sqlite> SELECT * FROM children;
1|Abigale Wong|5|false|female|1
2|Ben Wu|6|false|male|2
3|Drew Lee|6|false|male|3
4|Edward|8|true|male|1
5|Harriet Tam|9|false|female|4
6|Kelly Wong|7|false|female|1
7|Lily|4|true|female|2

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
-----------
sqlite> UPDATE children SET age = 10 WHERE name = "Harriet Tam";
sqlite> SELECT * FROM children WHERE name = "Harriet Tam";
5|Harriet Tam|10|false|female|4

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
-----------
sqlite> SELECT * FROM children,parents WHERE children.parents_id = parents.id;
1|Abigale Wong|5|false|female|1|1|Denis Wong|true
2|Ben Wu|6|false|male|2|2|Elaine Wu|true
3|Drew Lee|6|false|male|3|3|Gary Lee|false
4|Edward|8|true|male|1|1|Denis Wong|true
5|Harriet Tam|10|false|female|4|4|Rick Tam|true
6|Kelly Wong|7|false|female|1|1|Denis Wong|true
7|Lily|4|true|female|2|2|Elaine Wu|true

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) 
from both tables using one query.
-----------

sqlite> SELECT children.name, parents.name FROM children JOIN parents ON children.parents_id = parents.id;
Abigale Wong|Denis Wong
Ben Wu|Elaine Wu
Drew Lee|Gary Lee
Edward|Denis Wong
Harriet Tam|Rick Tam
Kelly Wong|Denis Wong
Lily|Elaine Wu

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
Harriet is now 10 and does not need the daycare. She was id 5.
-----------

sqlite> DELETE FROM children WHERE name = "Harriet Tam";
sqlite> SELECT * FROM children;
1|Abigale Wong|5|false|female|1
2|Ben Wu|6|false|male|2
3|Drew Lee|6|false|male|3
4|Edward|8|true|male|1
6|Kelly Wong|7|false|female|1
7|Lily|4|true|female|2
