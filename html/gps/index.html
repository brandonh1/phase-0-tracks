<!--
1. The purpose of html 5 semantic tags is to help improve readability and give meaning of the structure of your code.
2. The browser loads from top to bottom.
3. I knew about typing html[tab] before hand thanks to one of my partners but I didn't know you could create your own. I will definitely use these snippets in the future. If I'm creating something over and over again I will probably make a snippet of it.
4. I didn't understand what a snippet was before but afterwards I'm more familar with them. Just by creating more and looking at example snippets.
