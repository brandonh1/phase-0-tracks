##How I plan to learn jquery

* Google jquery functions/things for beginners
* There should be stuff to learn and examples on w3schools
* Modify and example code I see. Try to fix it after I break it, etc
* Keep track of important websites, materials, cheatsheets I come along
* Try to use jquery without any help
